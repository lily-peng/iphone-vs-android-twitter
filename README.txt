Files Used for the Creation of Our Website:

https://c9.io/necomni/journalism/workspace/index.html

Our HTML files:
index.html at https://c9.io/necomni/journalism/workspace/index.html

All the external javascript files we used are integrated into the website, so users do not need to download anything further.

We used:
codebird.js and sha1.js from https://github.com/mynetx/codebird-js
Google Maps API https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/


What was done:
- We used an online IDE (https://c9.io/) to write code in HTML, Javascript, and CSS for the website
- The website code was written in index.html, which imported from 
    - codebird.js and sha1.js from Codebird API
    - https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js from Google Maps API
    - jquery-1.8.3.min.js (jQuery)
- Had to understand the new Twitter v1.1 API and Google Maps API
- Heavy use of Javascript, some HTML and CSS to build the website
